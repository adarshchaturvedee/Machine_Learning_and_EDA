This folder holds the dataset and the Jupyter Interactive Python Notebook (.ipynb) file, for the task.

The day.csv (the comma separated values file) is the dataset used for this particular task.

BoomBikes_Case_Study_Linear_Regression.ipynb is the notebook with the work that I have done.

The problem statement:

BoomBikes is a shared bike rental service in the US and due to the pandemic, their rentals numbers have dropped. They wish to know what parameters are the most decisive in order to drive revenue and in turn the profits. They have provided a dataset of their rentals for two years, 2018 and 2019.
We will use linear regression to find the most important factors that must be targeted to maximise the profits of the business.
