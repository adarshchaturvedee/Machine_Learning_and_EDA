# Machine_Learning_and_EDA

This repositiory is to showcase my work on Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning(ML).

Exploratory Data Analysis is how we get to understand the dataset available to us. We can call it a dataset's 'interview'.
We ask some questions in code, and based on the information present in the dataset, it gives us the response.
We find how the dataset is arranged, its characteristics, we may find some patterns or trends that may be of interest.
We also find out its quirks or exceptions (outliers, etc.) if any.
At the end of the process, we can be fairly certain that we have a good understanding of the dataset.
Just like we ask questions to get to know a person, we ask questions to get to know the dataset.

Machine Learning is that subset of Artificial Intelligence that deals with training a model to predict things based on the dataset provided.
Whatever data we may have, we split into training and testing sets and let our model learn on the training set and make predictions on the testing set.
We may need to choose diferent appraoches to see which one fits our model the best.
A good way to do that is to visualise the data. It provides a visual cue as to which ML model will work well with that sort of data.
Based on the predictions, we see how much it deviates from the actual value, thus showing its accuracy.
Once the accuracy is in the acceptable range without overfitting, we can be sure that any data pertaining to that field in that format, will be dealt with appropriately and the model will provide the proper predictions.
